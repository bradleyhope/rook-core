4. Thin cities
5. Trading cities
6. Cities and eyes
7. Cities and names
8. Cities and the dead
9. Cities and the sky
10. Continuous cities
11. Hidden cities

## Opening Passage

Kublai Khan ekes not necessarily believe everything Marco
Polo says when he describes the cities visited on his expeditions, but the emperor of the Tartars does continue listening
10 the young Venetian with greater attention and curiosity
Ihan he shows any other messenger or explorer of his. In the
lives of emperors there is a moment which follows pride in
lhe 1I0undiess extension of the territories we have conquered,
and the melancholy and relief of knowing we shall soon
give up any thought of knowing and understanding them.
There is a sense of emptiness that comes over us at evening,
with the odor of the elephants after the rain and the sandalwood ashes growing cold in the braziers, a dizziness that
makes rivers and mountains tremble on the fallow curves of
lhe planispheres where they are portrayed, and rolls up, one
after the other, the despatches announcing to us the collapse
of the last enemy troops, from defeat to defeat, and flakes
lhe wax of the seals of obscure kings who beseech our
armies' protection, offering in exchange annual tributes of
precious metals, tanned hides, anti tortoise shell. It is the
desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which
had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless,
formless ruin, that corruption'S gangrene has spread too far
10 be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy
sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.

the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites'
gnawing.
